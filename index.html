       <h3 class="colorbrown">How to open Chrome </h3>
        <p>The Chrome browser only comes pre-installed and ready to use on Chromebooks. If you're using Microsoft Windows or an Apple computer, see: How to install or uninstall the Google Chrome browser. Once Chrome is installed, you can open it like any other program on your computer.</p>
        <h3 class="colorbrown">Overview and benefits</h3>
        <p id="colorred">Chrome works quite well with Google sites and services such as YouTube and Gmail. It also manages its system resources differently than other browsers. Its V8 JavaScript engine was developed from scratch at Google, and may improve your experience on heavily scripted websites and applications. Essentially, it should make the things you do on the Internet faster.
            After being installed, the Chrome browser is automatically configured to download and install updates when they're available. To verify updates are being installed automatically, see: How do I update my Internet browser?
        </p>
        <h3 class="colorbrown">Incognito mode</h3>
        <p class="colororange">Chrome offers a private browsing option called Incognito Mode. This mode allows you to browse in an isolated sandbox web session. It gives you temporary control over your browsing history and session identity, because when you close the browser, your logins and history are deleted. However, it does not guarantee anonymity.</article>
